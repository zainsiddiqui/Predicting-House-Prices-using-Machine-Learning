# Predicting-House-Prices-using-Machine-Learning
Program that uses Machine Learning to predict house prices based on historical data. The algorithm that is being implemented is known as "One-shot learning" which is known as linear regression with the least square error as the error measure.

* Project uses C programming language.
* Price of house is computed using the following equation: y = w0 + w1.x1 + w2.x2 + w3.x3 + w4.x4
* Inverse is being computed using the Gauss-Jordan Elimination method.
